# HeartRateMonitor
This VI acts as a heart rate monitor. It takes incoming voltage readings from a finger-clip heart-rate sensor and detects when there is a heart pulse (above 3 volts). It displays the voltage readings in real time on a waveform chart and keeps track of the number of pulses as well as the time elapsed. When stopped, the program outputs the average heart rate in beats/min.
